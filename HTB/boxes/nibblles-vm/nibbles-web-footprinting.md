- whatweb can help identify web application type
- gobuster can be used to bruteforce check for accessible pages/directories
- to concat env vars use this format "before${VAR}after" instead of the norm $VAR
- remember its export VAR="variabletext"
- example below
```bash
whatweb "http://${TARGET}/nibbleblog"
```

#   nibbleblog exploitation puzzle pieces 

- A nibbleblog install pottentially vulnerable to an authernticated file upload vulnerablility 
- An admin portal at nibbleblog/admin.php
- Directory listing which confirmed that admin is a valid username
- Login brute-forcing protection blacklists our IP address after toomany invalid login attempts. 
	-  this takes login brute-forcing with a tool such as Hydra off the table
- when password cracking offline using a tool such as Hashcat or attempting to guess a password, it is important to consider all the information in front of us.
- it is not uncommon to successfully crack a password hash (such as a company's network passphrase ) using a wordlist generated by crawling their website using a tool such as CeWL

>what have we done so far

- We started with a simple nmap, found two open ports 22,80
- Discovered the web app Nibbleblog
- Analyzed that web app and what tech is used by it using whatweb
- Found the admin login portal page at /nibbleblog/admin.php
- Confirmed that admin is a valid username
- Found out that IP blacklisting is enabled to prevent brute-force login attempts
- Uncovered clues that led us to a valid admin password of "nibbles"

# Takeaway

> A clear repeatable process that will be used over again, no matter if attacking a single target, or performing a full web app pen test, or attacking a large Active Directory env, is needed.

- the initial scope of a test can eem extremely small and "boring" yet once a few layers are pulled back through rounds of enumeration, you may find an exposed service on a high port or some forgotten page or dir that can lead to sensitive data exposure or even a foothold.

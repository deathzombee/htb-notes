# Information Gathering - Web - Skills Assessment

---

You've just decided to join in on the GitHub [bug bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program after a friend of yours got a large payout for a critical RCE flaw. After reading the rules carefully, you begin with passive and active information gathering and enumeration to attempt to uncover an interesting target. After reviewing the [scope](https://bounty.github.com/#scope), you decide to target the `githubapp.com` domain.

The description of this domain reads as follows:

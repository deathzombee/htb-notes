We can start looking further into the data to identify particular targets now that we have some information about our target. The [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) (`DNS`) is an excellent place to look for this kind of information. But first, let us take a look at what DNS is.

---

## What is DNS?

The DNS is the Internet's phone book. Domain names such as `hackthebox.com` and `inlanefreight.com` allow people to access content on the Internet. Internet Protocol (`IP`) addresses are used to communicate between web browsers. DNS converts domain names to IP addresses, allowing browsers to access resources on the Internet.

Each Internet-connected device has a unique IP address that other machines use to locate it. DNS servers minimize the need for people to learn IP addresses like `104.17.42.72` in `IPv4` or more sophisticated modern alphanumeric IP addresses like `2606:4700::6811:2b48` in `IPv6`. When a user types `www.facebook.com` into their web browser, a translation must occur between what the user types and the IP address required to reach the `www.facebook.com` webpage.

Some of the advantages of using DNS are:

- It allows names to be used instead of numbers to identify hosts.
- It is a lot easier to remember a name than it is to recall a number.
- By merely retargeting a name to the new numeric address, a server can change numeric addresses without having to notify everyone on the Internet.
- A single name might refer to several hosts splitting the workload between different servers.

There is a hierarchy of names in the DNS structure. The system's root, or highest level, is unnamed.

TLDs nameservers, the Top-Level Domains, might be compared to a single shelf of books in a library. The last portion of a hostname is hosted by this nameserver, which is the following stage in the search for a specific IP address (in `www.facebook.com`, the TLD server is `com`). Most TLDs have been delegated to individual country managers, who are issued codes from the [ISO-3166-1 table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes). These are known as country-code Top-Level Domains or ccTLDs managed by a United Nations agency.

There are also a small number of "generic" Top Level Domains (gTLDs) that are not associated with a specific country or region. TLD managers have been granted responsibility for procedures and policies for the assignment of Second Level Domain Names (SLDs) and lower level hierarchies of names, according to the policy advice specified in ISO-3166-1.

A manager for each nation organizes country code domains. These managers provide a public service on behalf of the Internet community. Resource Records are the results of DNS queries and have the following structure:

| **Term** | **Description** |
|----------|-----------------|
| `Resource Record` | A domain name (usually fully qualified) is the first part of a resource record. If not fully qualified, the zone's name is appended. |
| `TTL` | Time-To-Live in seconds. Defaults to the minimum specified in the SOA record. |
| `Record Class` | Specifies the class: typically `IN` (Internet), but may also be `HS` (Hesiod) or `CH` (Chaos). |
| `Start Of Authority` (`SOA`) | Must be first in a zone file. Defines the start of the zone and includes serial number, refresh interval, retry time, expiry, and minimum TTL. Only one `SOA` per zone. |
| `Name Servers` (`NS`) | Define the authoritative name servers for a zone. Also used to delegate authority to child zones. |
| `IPv4 Addresses` (`A`) | Maps a hostname to an IPv4 address. Used in forward lookup zones. |
| `Pointer` (`PTR`) | Maps an IP address to a hostname. Used in reverse lookup zones. |
| `Canonical Name` (`CNAME`) | Maps an alias hostname to another canonical hostname (which must have an `A` record). |
| `Mail Exchange` (`MX`) | Specifies mail servers for a domain, along with their priority. Multiple MX records can be defined. |

| **Term** | **Description** |
|----------|-----------------|
| `IPv6 Address` (`AAAA`) | Maps a hostname to an IPv6 address. Functions like an `A` record but for IPv6. |
| `Text` (`TXT`) | Stores arbitrary human-readable or machine-readable text. Commonly used for SPF records, domain verification, and policy info. |
| `Service` (`SRV`) | Specifies a host and port for services like SIP, XMPP, LDAP, etc. Includes priority, weight, port, and target hostname. |

## Nslookup & DIG

Now that we have a clear understanding of what DNS is, let us take a look at the `Nslookup` command-line utility. Let us assume that a customer requested us to perform an external penetration test. Therefore, we first need to familiarize ourselves with their infrastructure and identify which hosts are publicly accessible. We can find this out using different types of DNS requests. With `Nslookup`, we can search for domain name servers on the Internet and ask them for information about hosts and domains. Although the tool has two modes, interactive and non-interactive, we will mainly focus on the non-interactive module.

We can query `A` records by just submitting a domain name. But we can also use the `-query` parameter to search specific resource records. Some examples are:

#### Querying: A Records

DNS

```shell-session
cdeez@htb[/htb]$ export TARGET="facebook.com"
cdeez@htb[/htb]$ nslookup $TARGET

Server:		1.1.1.1
Address:	1.1.1.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	facebook.com
Address: 31.13.92.36
Name:	facebook.com
Address: 2a03:2880:f11c:8083:face:b00c:0:25de
```

We can also specify a nameserver if needed by adding `@<nameserver/IP>` to the command. Unlike nslookup, `DIG` shows us some more information that can be of importance.

DNS

```shell-session
cdeez@htb[/htb]$ dig facebook.com @1.1.1.1

; <<>> DiG 9.16.1-Ubuntu <<>> facebook.com @1.1.1.1
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 58899
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1

;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:

;; QUESTION SECTION:

```

The entry starts with the complete domain name, including the final dot. The entry may be held in the cache for `169` seconds before the information must be requested again. The class is understandably the Internet (`IN`).

#### Querying: A Records for a Subdomain

DNS

```shell-session
cdeez@htb[/htb]$ export TARGET=www.facebook.com
cdeez@htb[/htb]$ nslookup -query=A $TARGET

Server:		1.1.1.1
Address:	1.1.1.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
www.facebook.com	canonical name = star-mini.c10r.facebook.com.

```

DNS

```shell-session

#### Querying: PTR Records for an IP Address

DNS

```shell-session

Server:		1.1.1.1
Address:	1.1.1.1#53

So far, we have gathered `A`, `NS`, `MX`, and `CNAME` records with the `nslookup` and `dig` commands. Organizations are given IP addresses on the Internet, but they aren't always their owners. They might rely on `ISP`s and hosting providers that lease smaller netblocks to them.

We can combine some of the results gathered via nslookup with the whois database to determine if our target organization uses hosting providers. This combination looks like the following example:
